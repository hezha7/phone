          temporary phone number? Tese types of numbers are also known as DIDs
          (direct inward dialing), a telephone number without a directly
          associated telephone line. Typically they were used to<br />
          forward an incoming call to another num<br />ber. Such a virtual
          number works like a gateway between a normal call and VoIP (Voice Over
          IP). Other known names for a virtual phone number are fake phone
          number, temporary phone number and disposable phone number.
